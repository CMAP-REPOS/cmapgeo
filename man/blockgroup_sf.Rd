\details{
Census Bureau description:

\emph{"Block Groups (BGs) are statistical divisions of census tracts, are
generally defined to contain between 600 and 3,000 people, and are used to
present data and control block numbering. A block group consists of clusters
of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of
their four-digit census block number. For example, blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,
..., 3999 in census tract 1210.02 belong to BG 3 in that census tract. Most
BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureauâ€™s Participant
Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where
a local or tribal government declined to participate in PSAP, and a regional
organization or the State Data Center was not available to participate. A BG
usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG,
and BGs are uniquely numbered within the census tract. Within the standard
census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross state, county, or census tract
boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of any other geographic entity.
Tribal census tracts and tribal BGs are separate and unique geographic areas
defined within federally recognized American Indian reservations and can
cross state and county boundaries. The tribal census tracts and tribal block
groups may be completely different from the standard county-based census
tracts and block groups defined for the same area."}
