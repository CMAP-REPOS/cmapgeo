\details{
Census Bureau description:

\emph{"Blocks (Census Blocks or Tabulation Blocks) are statistical areas bounded
by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks,
and by nonvisible boundaries, such as selected property lines and city,
township, school district, and county limits and short line-of-sight
extensions of streets and roads. Generally, blocks are small in area; for
example, a city block bounded on all sides by streets. Blocks in suburban and
rural areas may be larger, more irregular in shape, and bounded by a variety
of features, such as roads, streams, and transmission lines. In remote areas,
blocks may even encompass hundreds of square miles. Blocks cover the entire
territory of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Blocks
nest within all other tabulated census geographic entities at the time of the
decennial census and are the basis for all tabulated data from that census.
Census Block Numbersâ€”Blocks are numbered uniquely with a four-digit census
block number from 0000 to 9999 within census tract, which nest within state
and county. The first digit of the census block number identifies the block
group. Block numbers beginning with a zero (in Block Group 0) are intended to
include only water area, but not all water-only blocks have block numbers
beginning with 0 (zero)."}
