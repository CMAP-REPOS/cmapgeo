Census Bureau description:

*"Census Tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a
county or statistically equivalent entity that can be updated by local
participants prior to each decennial census as part of the Census Bureauâ€™s
Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineates
census tracts in situations where no local participant responded or where
state, local, or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary
purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for
the presentation of statistical data.

*"Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000
people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. A census tract usually covers a
contiguous area; however, the spatial size of census tracts varies widely
depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are
delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that
statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. Census tracts
occasionally are split due to population growth or merged as a result of
substantial population decline.

\emph{"Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.
They may follow nonvisible legal boundaries, such as minor civil division
(MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some states and situations, to
allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the
governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and
county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census
geographic hierarchy. Tribal census tracts are a unique geographic entity
defined within federally recognized American Indian reservations and
off-reservation trust lands and can cross state and county boundaries. The
tribal census tracts may be completely different from the standard
county-based census tracts defined for the same area."}
